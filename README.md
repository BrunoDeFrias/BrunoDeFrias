# Hi, I’m Bruno 👋

![Me in my shop](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D5616AQEcS52fmt9Ahw/profile-displaybackgroundimage-shrink_350_1400/0/1712823314688?e=1721865600&v=beta&t=w29MS-tlAz37iwQmQHx77y1gSkO2yOzag8abGMvFvOY)

## About Me 🚀

From biodynamic vegetable gardener :carrot: (2009) to artisan flower shop owner :tulip: (2015) to **Web Dev Junior** :computer: (2024), there is indeed a common point:

`Never stop learning!` :blush:. 

And that's why I'm so excited :smiley: now to be a developer - with tech, `there is always something to learn!` - and not to rest on my achievements.  
I started my latest professional retraining with the bootcamp ![Le Wagon](https://www.lewagon.com/fr/web-development-course).

- 🌱 What I have learned there: **Ruby, JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, React.js, SQL, ActiveRecord, HTML5, CSS3, Sass, Bootstrap, Heroku, VSCode.**
- 🔭 What am I focusing on: **Javascript, React, Next.js**
- :technologist: My long-term objective: cybersecurity
- 🌍 Languages: **French, English, Portuguese, and learning Japanese; Music and programming** :wink: 
- 📫 How to reach me: **www.linkedin.com/in/bruno-de-frias** 

I know, I know, I'm not a senior, I'm a very **excited and overmotivated** junior guy looking for my first experience in a nice tech project.  
Soooo...
