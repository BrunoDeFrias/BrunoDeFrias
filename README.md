## About Me 🚀

To biodynamic vegetable gardener :carrot: (2009) into artisan flower shop owner :tulip: (2015) into **Web Dev Junior** :computer: (2024), there is indeed a common point :  

`Never stop learning !` :blush:. 

And that's why I'm so excited :smiley: now to be a developer and with tech : `there is always something to learn !` and not rest on my achievements.  
I started my latest professional retraining with the bootcamp ![Le Wagon](https://www.lewagon.com/fr/web-development-course).

- 🌱 what I have learned there : **Ruby, JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, React.js, SQL, ActiveRecord, HTML5, CSS3, Sass, Bootstrap, Heroku, VSCode.**
- 🔭 What am I focusing on : **Javascript, React, Next.js**
- :technologist: My long term objective : cybersecurity
- 🌍 Languages: **French, English, Portuguese and learning Japonese, Music and programming** :wink: 
- 📫 How to reach me: **www.linkedin.com/in/bruno-de-frias** 

I know, I know, I'm not a senior, I'm a very **excited and overmotivated** junior guy looking for my first experience in a nice tech project. Yeah... so you know : We all have to start somewhere :wink:
